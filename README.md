This is an ongoing effort to create a control system for a Quadcopter.

The current plan is to have an iPhone, or other iOS powered device, onboard the
quadcopter. It acts as a central control unit. The iOS device will communicate 
with an arduino controller through serial communication and have it
act as an interface to the actual motors.

This repository currently contains the iOS client.
